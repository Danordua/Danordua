### Hello there! My name is Dan. ðŸ›¹
I'm a beginner Web Developer ready to face new challenges and keep learning!

ðŸ•¹   I can work pretty good with JavaScript (especially ES6) and TypeScript. I really enjoy creating Web Apps with React Js and Redux.
    Also, I can manage myself around OOP and data structures.
 
ðŸŒ±   I'm on my way to be a Full Stack developer, so right now I'm learning a few things: 
    - I'm in the process of getting certified as a SQL Developer.
    - I'm learning Node Js so I can work on the Back End.
    - I'm getting familiar and studying all about Computer Science.

ðŸ”Ž   As I'm still learning a few things, I'd like to collaborate in any Web Dev project or any open source project.
